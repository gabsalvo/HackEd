**HackEd** is a web-based learning platform designed to help you develop skills in cybersecurity. Unlike other platforms, we focus on hands-on practice by solving specific cybersecurity exercises. A strong knowledge of C and Python is required.

## Access and Usage

You can access **HackEd** directly at [hacked23-24.web.app](https://hacked23-24.web.app). No installation is required as it is a Progressive Web App (PWA).
